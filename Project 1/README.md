# CSCI 5448 Project 1: Zoo

## Project Team

- Xinyu Jiang
- Qiuyang Wang

## Instructions to Run

1. Compile all of the `.java` files in the `src/` directory.
2. Run the main function in `Zoo.java`.
3. Input a number of days for which the program should run to see the program output.

*Note to Graders:* Internal code documentation highlighting examples of OO terms are under `/* */`-style Java comments so that they are easier to find.

## Issues Encountered

We did not really encounter many issues during development of this project, although we did have some discussions before coding had begun.

We discussed about where the best place to put the Animal special cases. At first, we wanted to implement these cases within the `exerciseAnimals` function in the Zookeeper class. But, this proved to be too complicated for a single function, so we decided it would be best to move these special cases to the cooresponding animals' classes instead.
